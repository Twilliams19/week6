In the server.js I changed a few thing. Some of it was in the if else statment. In the request url I added the 'login.html'. I also change the "./404.html" in else, into "/.login.html". I also changed the 404 into 200 to make it the same as the default system setting. However, I dont belive that this is the right way to get to the login page. That is where I have been having my problem.
